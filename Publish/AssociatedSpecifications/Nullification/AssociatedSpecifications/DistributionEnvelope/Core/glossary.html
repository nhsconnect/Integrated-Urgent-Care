Control Framework (ACF)</h4>
<div>Access to NHS Care Records Service data (on Spine) is controlled by the ACF 
	which registers and authenticates all users. It provides a single log-in and 
	a record of each healthcare professional accessing a patient's NHS care 
	record. All information is provided on a need-to-know basis and based on a 
	user's role and legitimate relationship; with the patient. It stores the
